  <h1 id="title1">About Us</h1>
  <p class="about">After getting to Uni, we realised the biggest challenge wasn't going to be choosing between seminars or smack, but making a meal with what was in the fridge. Deciding on what to eat is hard enough when you're at home and you've got a fully stocked fridge and a mum who'll cook for you, but when you're tired, hungry and broke, it's a whole new story.
That's where we come in. Whether you're veggie, vegan or just awful at cooking we've got a recipe for you. A bit of inspiration, a few veggies to send you on your way to your 5-a-day and the simplest of recipes will leave you feeling full and satisfied in no time at all.
Forget long tedious meal prep, ingredients you can't pronounce and piles of washing up you'll never do, have a lil' scroll, your next meal is only a click away.</p>
